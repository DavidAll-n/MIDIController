# MIDIController Library

## Background
This is a project to add easy MIDI connection ability for Arduino based projects. I started this after I acquired a very nice keyboard from a vintage organ and I wanted to use it as a MIDI controller with my synths.

## Hardware
This library is built to read data in from shift registers over SPI and analog inputs via a multiplexer. I have used an ATMega328P and 4021 shift registers with 74HC125 tri-state buffers.

## Contact
I offer this with no guarantee of support, but feel free to reach out with questions or comments.
